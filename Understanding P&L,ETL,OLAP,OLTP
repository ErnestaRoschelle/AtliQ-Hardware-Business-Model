Query cannot be carried out directly into the sales software because it might slow the system(machine critical)
So these data is put into another place called DataWarehouse
**Data Warehouse** -----> could be MySQL, ORACLE or mongoDB
                      or
                      special Dataware house such as Amazon REDSHIFT or teradata

Now Queries can be carried out in these Data Warehouse by **Data Analyst**
To copy all the data from machine critical to data warehouse there is a process called **ETL**(Extract Transform Load)

What is ETL?
E-Extract the data
T-Transform the data ----->Currency Normalization--->converting US Dollars to Indian rupees
                     ----->Derived columns--->calculate profit with columns available
                     ----->Aggregation --->when u want the data to be in monthly or quaterly wise 
All these are done by **Data Engineer**
