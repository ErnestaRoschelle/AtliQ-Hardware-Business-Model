1.What are Window functions?
2.When to use them?

1.Find out the % with respect to the total amount
SELECT *,
amount*100/sum(amount) over() as pct
FROM random_tables.expenses
order by category;

NOTE : Here over() is a window function and every row acts like a window

2.Find out the % with respect to the total amount grouped by category
SELECT *,
amount*100/sum(amount) over(partition by category) as pct
FROM random_tables.expenses
order by category;

NOTE : Here OVER(PARTITION BY ...) is a window function and each category serves as a window

3..Find out the amount spent with respect to category
SELECT *,
sum(amount) over(partition by category order by date) as total_till_date
FROM random_tables.expenses
order by date,category;



NOTE : Cumulative sum is adding the amount until all the amount has been added one by one 
example : Bank balance
